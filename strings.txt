HAVE PEOPLE ON THIS NO JOBS AT ALL?\nNOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, WHERE EVEN IS EVERYBODY?
ME, WHO IS THE GOD OF FIRE, WANTS TO ENLIGHTEN WHOLE WORLD.
MAYBE HIS WORLD WASN'T THAT BIG.
I AM ONIM, THE GOD OF FIRE.
WHY DID EVERYBODY VANISH?
THEY VANISHED BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID, AFRAID OF THE FIRE.\n AND THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ME.
YOU DON'T WANT\nTO LEAVE THE\nBEACH YET.
WELCOME TO\nSORIRA VILLAGE
OH LOOK, THE BOTTLE CONTAINS A LETTER.
THIS BOTTLE IS EMPTY.
A LIGHTER IS INSIDE THE BOX.
A SWORD IS INSIDE THE BOX.
POWER GLOVES ARE INSIDE THE BOX.
YOU LIGHT THE FLAME UP.
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LIGHT THIS UP.
YOU NEED A WEAPON TO CUT THIS DOWN.
